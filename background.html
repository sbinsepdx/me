    <h1>Background</h1>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>My name is Sebastian, and I was born in Portland, Oregon. I am 14 years old, and am going into 9th grade. I like biking, playing music, and 
        hiking. I have a cat, am part of a swim team, and speak two different languages. I am afraid of amusement park rides, and large bodies of water.
    </p>
    <h2>Early Life</h2>
    <p>In my earlier years, I went to Atkinson Elementary School, and loved soccer. I played with my friends afterschool everyday for at least an hour in the 
    shady field. Also, we had a big rivalry with the kids who used the other field, just South of ours. Each of our groups thought that they were cooler, and 
    that they had the better field. 
    </p>
    <h2>Middle School</h2>
    <p>In sixth grade, I went to Mt. Tabor Middle School, which seemed great at first, but soon became my worst nightmare.</p>

    <p> I only had one nice teacher, out of
        six, I was made fun of all the time, and the rules were so arbotrary and hard to deal with. So, in seventh grade, I switched schools. The new schools
        was far better than the previous one. I wasn't made fun of, and almost everyone was my friend.
